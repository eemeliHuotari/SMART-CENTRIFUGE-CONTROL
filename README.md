# SMART-CENTRIFUGE-CONTROL

Code, mock/example data, and pipelines developed for the Master’s thesis  
**“SMART Centrifuge Control”** (Eemeli Huotari, 2025).

**Note:** The original industrial dataset used in the thesis is **not publicly available** due to confidentiality.  
This repository includes **mock/example CSV files** that **mimic the structure and schema** of the real data, so you can run the full pipeline end-to-end. The outputs will be valid but do not reproduce the exact thesis results.
